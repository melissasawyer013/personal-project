            <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
            <p>
                We are a group of Dorchester residents, community organizers, and workers who are connected to Dorchester Not for Sale, Asian American Resource Workshop, Black Lives Matter Boston, New England United For Justice and other community organizations. The group was formed in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis. (Additional about us information will be included about the mission and goals.)
